The start of this project was straighforward but I still had a lot of trouble getting things to work together. 
We were given a hefty amount of time to work on our milestones so I took my time with this one unlike tests...

One of the most important concepts I think we had to learn was classes, constructors and deconstructors as this was all over the project.
It helped me identify and fix any memory leak issues.

The most confusing part of this project was the concepts of polymorphism and virtual functions.

Overall, CPP has gotta be one of the most confusing languages to learn and I do not plan on using it in the future for what I want to do.
Other than that, the first professor Nargis Khan did a poor job at teaching while the second professor Peter Liu did a much better job at explaining
concepts and interacting with class.
