This workshop we learned how to create a constructor and deconstructor.
Small tasks such as assigning values to the constructor functions, allocating dynamic memory, rellocate 
dynamic memory, and initializing member variables.

Constructors and be used to initialize values for certain variables and can take different parameters. 
This will assign a first value to an object when it is created. 

The deconstructor in fact, is a function of a class that is executed each time when an object is created.
